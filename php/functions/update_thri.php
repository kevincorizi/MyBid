     * This script performs the update of the value THR_i for the logged user.
     * There are four possible outcomes for this script:
     * 1) invalid_auction: the user is trying to change THR_i for a non-existing auction. This is a protection check to avoid JavaScript tampering
     * 2) smaller_than_bid: the user is trying to change THR_i to a value smaller than the current BID value
     * 3) bid_exceeded: the THR_i specified by the user is valid but it is not the new BID value
     * 4) highest_bidder: the THR_i specified by the user is big enough to make him the new highest bidder in the auction
